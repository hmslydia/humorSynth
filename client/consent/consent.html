          <b>TITLE:</b> Humor Writing Study  
          </p>

        <p>
<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> You are invited to participate in a research study on humor writing. This project is being conducted at Stanford University. This project aims to understand how we can teach people to write humor and how we can decompose the problem to allow people to collaborate more easier. During this session, we will ask you to read real newspaper heads and jokes. You may be asked to rate the jokes as funny, analyze them for linguistic properties, tell us what you associate with it, or to write humor. The session will not test you or your ability; rather it will help design teaching methods and user interfaces for experiencing the teaching methods. Your responses will be logged on a databased, but not identified with you. In an exit interview we will ask you about your experience and feedback. The digital files will be kept on a Stanford server.          
        </p>
        
        <p>
<b>TIME INVOLVEMENT:</b> Your participation will be a single 60-80 minute sessions.          
        </p>
        
        <p>
<b>RISKS AND BENEFITS</b>: The only risk associated with this study is reading jokes you may find offensive. To minimize this risk we have selected a subset of humor that is popular with the general population and not known for relying on offensive topics. A potential benefit of this study is that you may improve your knowledge of humor or techniques for clear and compelling writing. We cannot and do not guarantee or promise that you will receive any benefits from this study.
