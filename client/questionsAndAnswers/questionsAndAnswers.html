          Now that you have seen techniques for manipulating aspects of headlines, we want to show you some techniques for writing sentences rather than just words based on headlines which we call "Questions and Answers" because it involves asking a question and thinking of an answer to it.. 
          
        </p>
        <p>
          Here are the three Sentence-level techniques we will be showing you: 
          <ul>
            <li><b>Reactions</b> Is this good or bad? Why? Whether an aspect is good or bad, and possibly a reason for that reaction.</li>
            <li><b>Explanations</b> Why did this happen? Explaining why something happened, and possibly indicating whether it is good or bad.</li>
            <li><b>Effects</b> What will the effect of this be? Considers what the possible effects of an aspect will be, and possibly indicating whether that effect will be good or bad.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>  
        <p>
        These techniques have examples and give you practice identifying the technique in real jokes, but do not have writing exercises yet.
        Let's get started!
