          Now that you have seen that headlines can be decomposed into aspects, we want to show you some joke writing techniques that use these aspects. These techniques are all short because the use only one aspect. They don't result in a full joke, just a part of a joke, and we will have to build on it to create the actual joke. Because these techniques are short and combinable, we call them micro-techniques.

          We are going to show you multiple micro-techniques. For each one, there are three steps to learning about it: 
          <ul>
            <li><b>Introduction</b> Learn the technique through a definition and annotated examples.</li>
            <li><b>Identification</b> Practice identifying the usage of the technique in real jokes.</li>
            <li><b>Exercises</b> Do exercises related to using the technique yourself.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>  
        <p>
        Learning a new technique usually takes about 20 minutes. Let's get started!
