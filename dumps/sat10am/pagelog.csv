- There were a *lot* of options and often it was fuzzy which things to type where.  Like the practice parts are had the same label over the text box but were asking for different things.  I wish this was a pull down list or something.
- For practice, I wish there had been a bit more constraint when writing jokes.  Like have me write a joke with 3 or 4 techniques filled in already so I had to write a joke of that kind.  That would have given me a bit more practice trying to write a joke type I wouldn't normally.

"survey","survey-1","process","It was way easier, I actually had some techniques for figuring out a funny angle on the titles. It felt cool to try to put those into action rather than just think ""hm maybe I'm not funny."" ","survey","survey-2","useTechniques","Yes! I used the associations a lot, I found them really helpful for finding a new angle or a way to be sarcastic because I could very quickly put the headline in a new context and contrast it with things that might make it seem ridiculous. I used the violations because I knew that I had two choices -- helped to narrow it down and make it feel manageable. I used the expected reactions and expected beliefs because they helped me to be sarcastic more intentionally - I could use them to make sure the jokes violated expectations.","survey","survey-3","useful","Before, I was trying to think, I know there is something funny here...especially about the primate. But I was at a loss. Maybe if I had a few hours to mull it over I would have arrived at something.

I felt that I could express my own sense of humor better, even though I was using general techniques.","survey","survey-4","notuseful","The beliefs (e.g., pos/neg) were not so useful because I couldn't remember them, or really understand how to use them. I didn't really get that part.","survey","survey-5","recomment","Yes, I think it's fun! In the end, it felt cool to be able to write a joke. I'd like to show a friend and then compare jokes, that would be cool. It's a neat form of self-expression. I used to think being funny was just some talent some people had, but it's neat that you can work at it.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","JtMRnXL523KpXbSd4","1444701999633","meN7ebcK5ETaetGdR"

"survey","survey-1","process","I think I used very much the same process in my mind -- it was a very natural process from the beginning and this just helped me visualize and make sense of it better, but I don't think it necessarily improved my humor. Also, this survey has fried my brain so I think by the end I couldn't really make jokes to my best effort, though I do think they were better than my original jokes.","survey","survey-2","useTechniques","I definitely used angle and sarcasm, and the two connections. I feel like sarcasm and angle are the most significant part of the art of joke crafting. The two connections are pretty important as well because if you only have one connection, for example, the reader might be lost on what the joke is referencing.","survey","survey-3","useful","I think seeing examples of other people's humor was more useful to me than the breaking up and explanations of the jokes. But I might be wrong about that. Everything about humor is rather intuitive and in my opinion it's more about practice than about learning a set of vocabulary or a specific ordered process.

- There were a *lot* of options and often it was fuzzy which things to type where.  Like the practice parts are had the same label over the text box but were asking for different things.  I wish this was a pull down list or something.
- For practice, I wish there had been a bit more constraint when writing jokes.  Like have me write a joke with 3 or 4 techniques filled in already so I had to write a joke of that kind.  That would have given me a bit more practice trying to write a joke type I wouldn't normally.

I used the associations a lot, I found them really helpful for finding a new angle or a way to be sarcastic because I could very quickly put the headline in a new context and contrast it with things that might make it seem ridiculous.

But I was at a loss. Maybe if I had a few hours to mull it over I would have arrived at something.

- There were a *lot* of options and often it was fuzzy which things to type where.  Like the practice parts are had the same label over the text box but were asking for different things.  I wish this was a pull down list or something.
- For practice, I wish there had been a bit more constraint when writing jokes.  Like have me write a joke with 3 or 4 techniques filled in already so I had to write a joke of that kind.  That would have given me a bit more practice trying to write a joke type I wouldn't normally.

"survey","survey-1","process","It was way easier, I actually had some techniques for figuring out a funny angle on the titles. It felt cool to try to put those into action rather than just think ""hm maybe I'm not funny."" ","survey","survey-2","useTechniques","Yes! I used the associations a lot, I found them really helpful for finding a new angle or a way to be sarcastic because I could very quickly put the headline in a new context and contrast it with things that might make it seem ridiculous. I used the violations because I knew that I had two choices -- helped to narrow it down and make it feel manageable. I used the expected reactions and expected beliefs because they helped me to be sarcastic more intentionally - I could use them to make sure the jokes violated expectations.","survey","survey-3","useful","Before, I was trying to think, I know there is something funny here...especially about the primate. But I was at a loss. Maybe if I had a few hours to mull it over I would have arrived at something.

I felt that I could express my own sense of humor better, even though I was using general techniques.","survey","survey-4","notuseful","The beliefs (e.g., pos/neg) were not so useful because I couldn't remember them, or really understand how to use them. I didn't really get that part.","survey","survey-5","recomment","Yes, I think it's fun! In the end, it felt cool to be able to write a joke. I'd like to show a friend and then compare jokes, that would be cool. It's a neat form of self-expression. I used to think being funny was just some talent some people had, but it's neat that you can work at it.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","JtMRnXL523KpXbSd4","1444701999633","meN7ebcK5ETaetGdR"
