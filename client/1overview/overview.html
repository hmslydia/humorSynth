Now we’re going to teach you how to write jokes.
  </p>
  
  <p>
  Usually, people write jokes by intuition. All the steps that you do to construct the joke happen subconsciously. This can work very well, and you probably do it in every day life. </p>
  
  <p>However, joke writing doesn't have to be subconscious - it is a process that can be conscious and mechanized. Learning to write jokes in a conscious way can help open new avenues for joke writing that your subconscious might not have learned.
  </p>
  
  <p>
  We are going to teach you to write joke consciously in a style called <i>American Voices</i>. You have already seen this style. It starts with a <b>real news headline</b>, and then the writer invent <b>fake responses</b> from average Americans.

          <div class="exampleBox">
            {{> UI.dynamic template=exampleTemplate}} 
          </div>  
        {{/each}}

There are four basic steps we are going to teach you. 
  </p>
  
<ol>
  <li><b>Start with reading and understanding the headline more deeply,</b> noticing your reactions to it, and stating your reason for those reactions explicitly.</li>
  <li><b>Brainstorm associations with the headline.</b> You already know how to do this but we are going to show you even more techniques for it.</li>
  <li><b>Choosing a way to violate listeners’ expectations</b> based on the expected reason, reactions and associations. We will give you concrete techniques for this that help you complete any situation.</li>
  <li><b>Evaluating your joke</b> by seeing if it fits the “expectation violation” theory of humor.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Don’t expect to be able to follow the techniques in the order we listed. You may have to apply them more than once. For example, understanding, associating, then understanding again.
</p>
<p>
You’ll pick it up! Let’s get started.
